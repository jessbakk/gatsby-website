We buy underperforming real estate with the opportunity to add significant value by improving overall management, resolving deferred-maintenance issues and removing the properties obsolescence from the rental market. This is achieved by adding features and upgrades that will attract and meet the needs of today’s renters seeking a quality rental living environment.</p>
    <p>Barshay Capital continues to be bullish on seeking apartment assets in strategic locations that offer a favorable upside.
